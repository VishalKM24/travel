              10 Most Beautiful Islands Near Bali Last updated on September 7, 2020 in Beaches and Islands, Indonesia Leave a Comment
              Bali, otherwise known as the Island of the Gods, is the top travel destinations in Indonesia. Combining incredible 
              history with an exotic, spiritual culture, Bali offers something for everyone. Best of all, the island is truly beautiful, 
              boasting everything from lush green forests to mountains to white sand beaches. While Bali is a bucket list destination for 
              many, donâ€™t forget about the many islands near Bali that are just as exciting and scenic. 10 Moyo IslandMoyo Islandflickr/pablo_marx
              About 280 km (170 miles) from Bali is Moyo Island, which is located just north of the island called Sumbawa. Moyo Island is relatively
              remote and mostly undeveloped, save for one luxurious resort. As a result, Moyo Island is the epitome of a luxurious escape for those 
              who want to see a less crowded, more natural side of Indonesia, but who also want to make the most of upscale amenities. Most of the 
              island is covered in the Moyo Island Hunting Park, where there are no buildings and plenty of wildlife. The entire coastline of the 
              island is a marine conservation area, making it ideal for those who enjoy scuba diving or snorkeling.</h4>
